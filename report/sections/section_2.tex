\label{sec:Section 2: Gender Wage Gaps}

From our descriptive analysis, it is self evident that there exists substantial raw differences in wages, education, and coworker wage environments between men and women. These gaps raise a natural question: to what extent do observable characteristics—such as education and potential experience—account for the wage differences we see, and how much remains unexplained by these factors? Here we begin to attempt to formally investigate these questions by estimating standard wage models and applying the Oaxaca decomposition to separate the portion of the gender wage gap attributable to differences in characteristics from the portion attributable to differences in returns to those characteristics.

Across the pooled models, the coefficient on the female indicator is negative and statistically significant, indicating that women earn lower wages on average even before conditioning on observable characteristics. In the baseline model that includes only a constant and the female dummy, the coefficient of approximately $-0.208$ suggests that women earn roughly 20\% lower wages than men at period~0. After adding categorical controls for education and a cubic polynomial in experience, the wage gap widens to about 27\%, reflecting that women in our sample tend to have slightly higher educational attainment and similar experience levels. Thus, once controlling for these favorable characteristics, the remaining wage gap attributable to gender becomes larger.

The separate regressions by gender show broadly similar returns to education and experience for men and women. Returns to schooling rise with each additional educational category, while experience exhibits diminishing marginal returns. The largest difference lies in the intercepts: men have a higher baseline log wage than women, implying that even at comparable education and zero experience, men start from a higher predicted wage level. 


Yet this baseline gap is muddied between differences in the composition of the characteristics of each group (e.g., average education levels) and differences in the returns to those characteristics (e.g., how much additional education translates to wage increases). In other words, while these regressions quantify the wage gap and its relationship to observable traits, part of the wage gap may be due to differences in the average education and experience levels (composition effects), while another being due to differences each group being paid differently for the same education or experience, or actual gender discrimination, which is the object of our study. 

To separate the portion of the wage gap arising from differences in average
characteristics from the portion arising from differences in how those
characteristics are rewarded in the labor market, we apply the Oaxaca
decomposition of \citet{oaxacaMaleFemaleWageDifferentials1973} using the
gender-specific regressions in Columns (3) and (4). Let $y_{gi}$ denote log
hourly wages for individual $i$ in group $g \in \{m,f\}$ and let $X_{gi}$ be
the vector of observable characteristics (education dummies and a cubic
polynomial in potential experience).\footnote{The intercept is excluded from
$X_{gi}$ and treated separately.} We model wages as
\begin{equation}
  y_{gi} = \alpha_g + X_{gi}'\beta_g + \varepsilon_{gi},
  \qquad g \in \{m,f\}.
\end{equation}
Taking sample means yields
\[
  \bar y_g = \hat\alpha_g + \bar X_g' \hat\beta_g.
\]
The raw gender wage gap is defined as
\[
  \Delta \equiv \bar y_m - \bar y_f.
\]

Using women as the reference group, the Oaxaca decomposition expresses
$\Delta$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:oaxaca}
  \Delta 
  = (\bar X_m - \bar X_f)' \hat\beta_f 
    \;+\; \bar X_m'(\hat\beta_m - \hat\beta_f).
\end{equation}

The first term,
\[
  (\bar X_m - \bar X_f)' \hat\beta_f,
\]
is the \emph{explained} or \emph{between-group} component: it reflects how
differences in average education and experience across men and women would
translate into a wage gap if both groups received the same returns estimated
for women.  

The second term,
\[
  \bar X_m'(\hat\beta_m - \hat\beta_f),
\]
is the \emph{unexplained} or \emph{within-group} component: it captures
differences in the returns to these characteristics, evaluated at men’s mean
characteristics.

Applying equation~\eqref{eq:oaxaca} to our estimates, we obtain an explained
component of approximately $-0.0623$, indicating that women's observable
characteristics would predict \emph{higher} wages than men if both groups were
rewarded according to the female returns. The unexplained component is about
$0.1071$, showing that men receive higher returns to education and experience
than women. This unexplained component dominates, yielding a total wage gap of
roughly $0.0448$ log points, or about $4.5\%$, in favor of men.
